## 🧠 Overview  
**Soundify** is a sleek and responsive music player web app that replicates the core features of Spotify. It enables users to browse, play, and interact with audio tracks through an intuitive, dynamic interface—all built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Whether you're a developer exploring frontend projects or a music enthusiast experimenting with audio web APIs, Soundify brings streaming to the browser in style.

## ✨ Features  
- 🎵 **Custom Music Player:** Built from scratch using JavaScript and the HTML5 `<audio>` API  
- ⏯️ **Play/Pause & Seek Controls:** Fully functional playback system with real-time updates  
- 🧠 **Metadata Display:** Shows track name and artist dynamically  
- 📁 **Folder-Based Song Management:** Organizes music based on user-defined folders  
- 🌙 **Responsive Design:** Clean, mobile-friendly interface with smooth transitions  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Playlist Switching:** Seamlessly switches between genre/theme folders

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Web APIs:** HTML5 Audio API, DOM Manipulation  
- **Tools Used:** VS Code, GitHub Pages (optional for deployment)  
- **Assets Source:** [Saregama](https://www.saregama.com/) for sample music tracks

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. **Loads Songs from JSON:** Songs and metadata are mapped via JSON for easy scalability  
2. **Audio Control Binding:** All controls (play, pause, next, seek) are wired using JavaScript event listeners  
3. **Dynamic Rendering:** Song titles, artists, and UI elements update in sync with playback  
4. **Folder Navigation:** Different genre folders like `Punjabi101`, `BollyCentral`, etc., load different song sets dynamically
